    "## **Tokens in LLMs**\n",
    "\n",
    "In LLMs, text is **not** processed directly as raw characters or full words. Instead, it's broken down into smaller units called **tokens**. Tokens are units of language that can be arranged to form any text input.\n",
    "\n",
    "A token can be a word, a part of a word (subword), a punctuation mark, etc... For example, the sentence \"What's the weather?\" might be tokenized into `[\"What\", \"'s\", \" the\", \"wea\", \"ther\", \"?\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why are Tokens Used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing text at the character level lets us represent any sequence of text, but is computationally expensive and creates very long sequences. Processing at the word level is simpler, but requires a representation for every word the model could potentially see. Breaking words into subwords is a middle ground that provides the flexibility of character level-representations and the simplicity of word-level representations without the issues they both present.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of unique tokens that a model is trained on is called its vocabulary. Vocabulary size varies between models, but typically falls in the range of 100,000 to 150,000 for state of the art LLMs. The choice of vocabulary size is a trade-off: a larger vocabulary can represent more words directly, leading to shorter sequences, but it also increases the model's complexity and memory footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **For our model, we will assume a tiny vocabulary size of only 20. Our input text will be some combination of these 20 tokens, and our output will be the best choice of these 20 tokens given our input.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, our input will only be two tokens and we will treat whole words as tokens. Run the cell below and pick your two word input."

    "\n",
    "Now that we have our Token IDs, we need a way for the model to actually understand what these tokens *mean*. A single integer ID doesn't capture the semantic meaning, context, or relationships of a word. This is where **Embeddings** come in.\n",
    "\n",

    "You can think of each number in this list as the degree to which a token possesses a specific \"feature\" or \"concept\". For example, the first number in an embedding might correspond with how \"positive\" a word is, another how \"action-oriented\" a word is, or whether it relates to \"animals\" vs \"objects\". By representing our tokens as a series of these numbers, the model can understand that words with similar numbers (like \"cat\" and \"dog\") have similar meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This list of numbers is the *meaning* of the token, represented in numbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Where do these numbers come from?**\n",
    "The model doesn't start off knowing what these numbers should be for each token. **Embeddings are learned during training.** The token embeddings start off random. As the model learns to predict the next word in a sequence, it adjusts these numbers to better reflect the token's meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Our 8D Embeddings**\n",
    "Each number in the embedding vector is the value of that token in a particular dimension. Real LLMs use very large embeddings (e.g., thousands of dimensions per token). For simplicity, we will use **8-Dimensional (8D) embeddings**. This means each token in our vocabulary of 20 tokens will be represented by a list of 8 numbers. Each number corresponds to a value in a particular dimension, which can be thought of as the degree to which the token possesses a specific feature.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we know that a self-attention layer has multiple heads, and each makes recommendations for how our tokens should be changed, let's look at how this is actually done. Each head has a set of three learned weight matrices: the **Query (Q)**, **Key (K)**, and **Value (V)** matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are used to transform each token embedding into three vectors:\n",
    "- **Query Vector:** \"What am I looking for?\"\n",
    "- **Key Vector:** \"What do I contain?\"\n",
    "- **Value Vector:** \"If you attend to me, here is what I offer.\"\n",

    "If this is your first exposure to the self-attention mechanism, this probably makes no sense. We will go into further detail on each of these soon, but for now let's focus on how they are created.\n",

    "#### **Matrix Multiplication Basics: Mapping 8D to 4D**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the Q, K, and V vectors, we project our 8D token embeddings down to 4D using **matrix multiplication**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of matrix multiplication as a way to route and mix signals. Our input embedding has 8 numbers. We want an output vector with 4 numbers. To get from 8 to 4, we multiply our 1x8 embedding by an 8x4 **weight matrix**, creating a 1x4 vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the 4 columns in the 8x4 weight matrix contains 8 numbers and is responsible for taking our 8D embedding and producing a single number. It does this by multiplying each of the 8 numbers in our embedding by a corresponding number from the column. This produces 8 products which are summed into one final number. Doing this for all 4 columns smoothly maps our 8D embedding into a 4D vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "More simply, each column in the 8x4 weight matrix turns ours 8D embedding into one number. There are 4 columns. So our 8D embeddings are mapped to 4D.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our model has **2 attention heads**, and each head needs its own Query, Key, and Value representations, we will need **6 separate learned weight matrices** in total (3 for Head 1, and 3 for Head 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crucially, the numbers inside these Q, K, and V weight matrices are learned during training.** As the model trains, it slowly adjusts these weights to extract the most effective Q, K, and V representations from any given token.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Note: What we are using here is *Standard Multi-Head Attention*. Modern state-of-the-art architectures often use tricks to reduce memory overhead. But in order to understand them, it is necessary to understand the basics first. If interested, I encourage you to check out Multi-Head Latent Attention later.)*\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have our query, key, and value vectors for each token embedding, what do we actually do with them? Two of these vectors (the Query and Key) represent what each embedding would find useful and what it has to offer. If the Query of one token matches the Key of another token, they will interact via the Value vector of the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps me to think of these interactions as a marketplace:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Query** (`q`): The \"Consumer Need\". What is this token looking for? (e.g., \"I am an adjective looking for a noun\").\n",
    "- The **Key** (`k`): The \"Advertisement\". What info does this token claim to have to offer other tokens? (e.g., \"I could describe a noun\").\n",
    "- The **Value** (`v`): The \"Product\". If a Query matches this token's Key, this is the information that gets passed along.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a single attention head, the process works roughly like this: Each token's Query vector is compared against the Key vectors of *all* tokens in the sequence (including its own). By comparing a Query to a Key, we determine to what degree there is a match. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know the strength of the match between a token's Query and all Keys, we take a proportionate amount of each token's **Value** vector. If the match is strong, we take a large amount of its Value; if the match is weak, we take very little. We then add all these scaled Value vectors together to form one vector that serves as the recommended update for our original token's embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if Token A is \"fast\" (an adjective) and Token B is \"car\" (a noun), Token B's Query might strongly match Token A's Key. Therefore, Token B takes a large chunk of Token A's Value vector to understand that it is not just a car, it is a fast car.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider the sentence: \"The light is orange\". Regardless of where it appears in the sentence, the token for \"orange\" will start with the exact same embedding. But, because of the way the attention mechanism works, \"The light is orange\" and \"The orange is light\" would be processed the exact same way, even though they mean very different things. So, how do we fix this? How do we give the model the ability to understand that \"orange\" is a color, not a fruit? \n",

    "\n",
    "To add this positional information, modern LLMs use a technique called **Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of adding position information to the token's main embedding at the very beginning, RoPE waits until the Query and Key vectors have been created inside the attention head. It then applies a mathematical rotation to these Query and Key vectors based on their position in the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "By rotating the vectors, RoPE injects information about their relative distances from each other. The model can then easily tell how far apart two tokens are, allowing it to understand the order of the words. The intricacies of RoPE are beyond the scope of this lesson, but the important takeaway is that our Query and Key vectors are adjusted to include positional context before they interact.\n",

    "## **The Dot Product: Comparing Queries and Keys**\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, we have taken two words, represented them as tokens, represented our tokens as embeddings, normalized those embeddings, and fed them into the 2 heads of our first self-attention layer. Each head used them to create a **Query (Q)**, **Key (K)**, and **Value (V)** vector. We just added positional info by rotating the Q and K vectors using RoPE.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready for the attention mechanism. As previously mentioned, within each head, each token's query is compared to all tokens' keys to determine the degree to which they match. but how is this done? How do we determine the degree to which two vectors match? These comparisons use the **dot product**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What is the Dot Product?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors and returns a single number. This number tells us *how similar* those two vectors are. You can think about this calculation in two entirely different, but mathematically identical, ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) The Intuitive Way**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we treat both of our 4D vectors (the Query and the Key we are comparing) as coordinates for a specific point in 4D space and draw arrows to these two points, the dot product starts by looking at the angle between these two arrows and returning a value between -1 and 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If they point in the exact same direction, it returns 1. \n",
    "- If they are perpendicular (unrelated), it returns 0. \n",
    "- If they point in exact opposite directions, it returns -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then multiplies this \"angle match score\" by the lengths of the two arrows themselves. That final result is our dot product.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) The Computational Way**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the method that the LLM actually uses under the hood. In practice, you don't actually need to calculate any angles to find the dot product value. All you have to do is line up the two vectors, multiply their values together (1st number in Q x 1st number in K, 2nd number in Q x 2nd number in K, etc), and then add all those resulting products together into one sum. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: If this sounds familiar, it's because this is exactly what we did above when we turned our 8D embeddings into the Q, K, and V vectors via the learned weight matrices.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why does the dot product matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it gives us a **single score** quantifying to what degree two tokens are similar. Remember, Q is a representation of what a token would find useful, and K is a representation of what a token has to offer. Comparing these two yields to what degree tokens \"match\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For each token in each attention head, we compute the dot product between its query and *all* keys in the sequence (including its own key). Run the cell below to see this in action by calculating the dot product between Token 1's Query and Token 1's Key in the first attention head."

    "## **The Attention Weights**\n",
    "\n",
    "We've calculated our raw dot products. These numbers tell us how much each Query matches each Key. But what do we actually *do* with these raw match scores? \n",
    "\n",
    "Our ultimate goal is to figure out what percentage of each token's Value vector we should mix together. For example, we want to be able to say: *\"To update Token 2 in Head 1, we should take 80% of Token 1's Value and 20% of Token 2's Value.\"* We need to turn our raw math scores into a clean probability distribution that sums to 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we use a function called **Softmax**. But before we can pass our raw scores through Softmax, we have two critical steps to execute: **Scaling** and **Masking**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Scaling the Scores**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we compute the dot product for larger and larger vectors, the resulting match score can become quite large. The issue is that Softmax relies on an exponential function. If we feed very large numbers into Softmax, the exponential component will make the differences between those numbers massive—pushing the highest score up to roughly 100% and completely crushing all other scores down to 0%. The attention mechanism loses its ability to blend subtle context and becomes extremely rigid.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, we implement **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**. Statistically, the variance of a dot product of two independent vectors grows with their dimension. By dividing our raw match scores by the square root of our head dimension (which is $\\sqrt{4} = 2$), we scale down this variance. This simple division pushes the values closer together, ensuring they stay in a stable mathematical range so the exponential component of Softmax behaves properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: The Causal Mask**\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs generate text one token at a time from left to right. We need to ensure that tokens can only look backwards and never forwards. To enforce this, we apply a **Causal Mask** to our scores. We take any match score that represents a token looking \"into the future\" and replace it with negative infinity ($-\\infty$). Later, when we apply Softmax, any negative infinity value will be mathematically reduced to exactly 0%, guaranteeing that future tokens have absolutely no influence on past tokens.\n",

    "## **Softmax: Creating Probabilities**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our scaled and masked scores, we need to convert them into actual probabilities. This will tell us exactly what portion of each Value vector we should combine.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we use a mathematical function called **Softmax**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What is Softmax?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax takes a list of numbers and converts them into a probability distribution. It ensures that all resulting values are between 0 and 1 (acting as percentages), and that all the values sum up to exactly 1 (100%). \n",
    "\n",
    "It does this by taking the mathematical constant $e$ raised to the power of each number, and then dividing that by the sum of all exponentiated values in the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Softmax}(x_i) = \\frac{e^{x_i}}{\\sum_j e^{x_j}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why is Softmax useful here?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main reasons we use Softmax in our attention mechanism:\n",
    "1. **It creates percentages:** We need clean percentages (weights) to determine how much of each token's Value vector to mix together.\n",
    "2. **It handles negative infinity gracefully:** Remember our causal mask? We set future token match scores to negative infinity ($-\\infty$). Mathematically, $e^{-\\infty}$ is exactly 0. This guarantees that future tokens get a **0%** weight, completely evaporating their influence during the current token's update!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write our Softmax code, pass our masked scores through it, and visualize our final attention weights distributions."

    "\n",
    "#### **How we use the Attention Weights**\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the final update for a token from a specific attention head, we literally take portions of all the available Value vectors and add them together. The size of the portion we take is equal to the percentages we calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if Token 1's Softmax weights for Head 1 are [100%, 0%], it means Token 1 will take 100% of Token 1's Value vector, and 0% of Token 2's Value vector. We scale the Value vectors by these percentages, and sum them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical equation for a single token's update looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Update} = (\\text{Weight}_1 \\times \\text{Value}_1) + (\\text{Weight}_2 \\times \\text{Value}_2) + \\dots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This resulting vector is the recommended update for the token from the attention head. Because we have multiple heads, each head will output its own independent 4D recommendation for how the token should be updated based on its own specific expertise.\n",

    "## **Adding Updates to Original Embeddings**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our highly refined, context-aware update vectors, you may assume these directly replace our old token embeddings. But these vectors are instead added to the original embeddings. We utilize what is know as a **residual connection** or **residual stream**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Residual Stream**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the residual stream as a way to connect our original embeddings and our updates. Basically, any time we are going to use our embeddings to determine how they should be updated, we make a copy of them and put them aside. Once we have determined how they should be changed, we bring them back and apply the changes.\n",
    "Mathematically, it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{New Embedding} = \\text{Current Embedding} + \\text{Update} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why do we simply add them?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main reasons for this:\n",
    "1. **Preserving Original Meaning:** Our original embeddings contain valuable \"dictionary-definition\" information. By adding updates to them instead of replacing them, we retain that foundational base meaning while superimposing new contextual nuance on top. \n",
    "2. **Alleviating Information Loss:** In deep networks with dozens of layers, repeatedly transforming a vector can cause its original signal to degrade. By having an uninterrupted residual stream where information just gets incrementally added, the model remains stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add in our updates to create our new representations. We will then compare these new contextualized embeddings to the original isolated embeddings we started with."

    "\n",
    "Before we move on, let's take a moment to recap the journey our text has taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we took our raw words and represented them as **tokens**. We then converted those tokens into numerical representations called **embeddings** via a learned lookup matrix. To ensure the mathematical stability of our network as these numbers pass through the model, we **normalized** them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, these stable embeddings were fed into a **Self-Attention Layer**, where each independent head got to work. Using learned weight matrices, each head converted them into three lower-dimensional vectors: the **Query (Q)**, **Key (K)**, and **Value (V)** vectors. To ensure our model understands the order of the words, two of these vectors (the Q and K) were then rotated via **Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)** to encode positional info.\n",
    "\n",
    "With our position-aware vectors ready, we used them to compare all tokens to each other and calculate a similarity score via the **dot product**. We then normalized these scores for stability in our network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then used these values to determine for each token in each head what proportion of its update should come from each token by converting our raw similarity scores into a probability distribution using **Softmax**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then used these attention scores to take a proportionate amount of each token's **Value** vector. We added these together to get each head's recommendation for each token.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendations from each head were lined up next to each other and ran through one final learned weight matrix that converts the recommendations into actual updates. Finally, we added our updates to our original token embeddings to create updated **contextualized embeddings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have just completed the **Self-Attention** layer of our model. This exact mechanism is what has allowed AI models to do the incredible things that have captivated the world over the past couple years. I truly believe understanding how it works is one of the most valuable skills you can have in the modern era.\n",

    "Now that our tokens have \"talked\" to each other through the self-attention mechanism, we let the model look at each token individually and decide what information to add to it. This is where the model uses what it learned while getting trained. Large LLMs are trained on an ungodly amount of text, so they have a vast amount of knowledge baked into their weights. This next step—the Feed-Forward Network—lets them apply this knowledge to our tokens one by one.\n",
    "\n",

Just as we did before entering the self-attention layer, we will apply **RMSNorm** to our updated embeddings, followed immediately by another learned **Gain** vector.\n",

    "\n",
    "While self-attention routes information *between* tokens to create more contextualized embeddings, the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) is where the model applies the vast knowledge it memorized during training to *each individual token embedding*. It uses the added context from self-attention to determine what information needs to be added to each token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarifying what happens in each step of the FFN while being completely accurate would make this lesson much longer and less accessible. Therefore, I have leaned into the **monosemantic neuron hypothesis**. This view is the easiest to understand, but it is not entirely accurate. What actually goes on in LLMs is still a highly debated area of research, but treating each dimension as a single feature is almost certainly untrue. But it does make the process easier to understand and is a good starting point to build upon. It's also more likely to be true in tiny models like ours. So, it's technically not inaccurate in this context. Just keep in mind that my explanation is a simplification of what is actually going on in large models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FFN consists of three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Up-Projection:** Converts our embedding into a higher dimension by determining to what degree our embedding matches a set of features. In our case a learned weight matrix of 8x24 determines the degree to which our 8D embedding matches 24 different features, and represents this information in a 24D vector.\n",
    "2. **Activation Function:** Applies a mathematical filter to keep useful features and discard useless ones.\n",
    "3. **Down-Projection:** Takes the information that made it past the filter and uses it to decide what information needs to be added to this particular token and maps this back down to the original embedding dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: The Up-Projection**\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we take our normalized 8D embeddings and multiply them by a learned weight matrix. This is called the **Up-Projection**. We will project our 8D embeddings into **24 dimensions** (a 3x expansion). Therefore our Up-Projection weight matrix will be 8 rows x 24 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how we used the dot product to determine to what degree queries matched keys? This works similarly. Each column in the up-projection matrix represents a particular feature. We compare each 8D embedding to all 24 columns (each also 8D) to determine the degree to which our embedding matches the 24 features the model learned to look for during training. The result of this comparison is a 24D vector for each token embedding that serves as a \"profile\" of sorts for the network to work with. The model basically uses this matrix to study each token embedding and extract information from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "By blowing up our embedding from 8 dimensions to 24 dimensions, we are effectively giving the model 24 different \"slots\" or \"scratchpads\" to evaluate our token against. It \"disentangles\" the dense 8D vector, separating it out to ask 24 very specific questions like: *\"To what degree does this token relate to animals?\"*, *\"Is it a plural noun?\"*, *\"Does it usually precede a verb?\"* \n",
    "\n",
    "The up-projection provides the necessary \"width\" for the model to consider many features simultaneously. In most LLMs, the up-projection gives the model 1000s of dimensions to work with rather than our tiny 24.\n",

    "### **Step 2: The Activation Function (ReLU)**\n",
    "\n",
    "An activation function is a mathematical filter. It looks at the numbers in our newly expanded 24D vector and decides which \"signals\" to let through and which to block. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will use one of the most common activation functions in deep learning: **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit). \n",
    "\n",
    "*(Note: While easy to understand, ReLU is rarely used in state-of-the-art LLMs today. Modern models typically use architectures like **SwiGLU** or **GLU**. However, they both serve the exact same mathematical purpose: introducing non-linearity to filter through our features and only pass forward the most active, relevant signals.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How does ReLU work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is incredibly simple! ReLU looks at every single number in our vector.\n",
    "- If the number is **positive**, it leaves it alone.\n",
    "- If the number is **negative**, it changes it to **0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is just: `f(x) = max(0, x)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why is this important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If each of our 24 dimensions is a separate \"feature\" or \"concept\" our model is considering, then: \n",
    "- A positive number means: *\"Yes, I found this feature!\"*\n",
    "- A negative number means: *\"No, I did not find this feature.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "By crushing all negative numbers to 0, ReLU effectively \"turns off\" the features that aren't relevant to this specific token. This creates a **sparse representation**, where only the active, relevant features are passed forward to the next step. It's a way for the model to make a definitive decision: a feature is either present (positive number) or it is completely ignored (zero)."

    "\n",
    "After traveling through several attention blocks, our embeddings are rich with context and deeply infused with the model's learned knowledge. We are ready to predict our next token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's focus on the last token in our sequence: **Token 2**. Its embedding is no longer just the dictionary-definition of the token it started as. It is now a highly complex, context-aware mathematical representation that has been continuously molded by its interactions with all preceding tokens and by the vast knowledge the model applied in its Feed-Forward Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the **causal mask** we applied during the self-attention phase, only the final token embedding in our sequence is able to absorb the context of the *entire* sequence up to this point. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to predict what the next token should be, **we only need to use Token 2's embedding**. We don't need to look back at Token 1 because Token 2 already has Token 1's context safely baked into its numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we convert this 8D embedding to a next token prediction? We run this final embedding through one last learned weight matrix. This matrix will map our embedding to a vector that has the exact same dimension as the size of our vocabulary (which is 20 in our model). Each number in this new 20-dimensional vector corresponds directly to one specific token in our vocabulary. This matrix effectively calculates a \"score\" for every single word in the vocabulary, quantifying how good of a fit each word is to be the next token in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we can pass our embedding through this final matrix, we have to do one last **RMSNorm** step to ensure it is stable."

Each 8D column in the unembedding matrix represents a word in our vocabulary (e.g., column 0 might be 'cat', column 1 might be 'is').

    "\n",
    "Temperature is a parameter that we apply to our logits *before* we pass them into the Softmax function. It allows us to control the \"creativity\" or \"randomness\" of our model's predictions. Mathematically, it works by simply dividing every logit by the Temperature value ($T$).\n",

    "- **High Temperature ($T > 1$)**: Makes the model more \"creative\". By dividing the logits by a large number, we shrink the differences between them. The Softmax function produces a much \"flatter\" probability distribution where many tokens have a similar chance of being chosen.\n",
    "- **Low Temperature ($T < 1$)**: Makes the model more \"confident\" and \"deterministic\". By dividing by a small fraction (which is the same as multiplying), we stretch out the differences. The top scores become huge relative to the bottom scores. Softmax then pushes the highest probability even higher, and crushes the lower ones. The model almost exclusively picks the top prediction.\n",
    "- **Default Temperature ($T = 1$)**: No change. The logits are exactly as calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Visualizing the Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write the code to see Temperature in action! We will divide our `logits` array by our `temperature` parameter, pass the adjusted logits through Softmax, and graph the resulting probability distribution across our 20 tokens! \n",
