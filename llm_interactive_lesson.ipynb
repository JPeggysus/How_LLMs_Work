    "## **Tokens in LLMs**\n",
    "\n",
    "In LLMs, text is **not** processed directly as raw characters or full words. Instead, it's broken down into smaller units called **tokens**. Tokens are units of language that can be arranged to form any text input.\n",
    "\n",
    "A token can be a word, a part of a word (subword), a punctuation mark, etc... For example, the sentence \"What's the weather?\" might be tokenized into `[\"What\", \"'s\", \" the\", \"wea\", \"ther\", \"?\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why are Tokens Used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing text at the character level lets us represent any sequence of text, but is computationally expensive and creates very long sequences. Processing at the word level is simpler, but requires a representation for every word the model could potentially see. Breaking words into subwords is a middle ground that provides the flexibility of character level-representations and the simplicity of word-level representations without the issues they both present.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of unique tokens that a model is trained on is called its vocabulary. Vocabulary size varies between models, but typically falls in the range of 100,000 to 150,000 for state of the art LLMs. The choice of vocabulary size is a trade-off: a larger vocabulary can represent more words directly, leading to shorter sequences, but it also increases the model's complexity and memory footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **For our model, we will assume a tiny vocabulary size of only 20. Our input text will be some combination of these 20 tokens, and our output will be the best choice of these 20 tokens given our input.**\n",

    "## **Using Query, Key, and Value Vectors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our query, key, and value vectors for each token embedding, what do we actually do with them? Two of these vectors (the Query and Key) represent what each embedding would find useful and what it has to offer. If the Query of one token matches the Key of another token, they will interact via the Value vector of the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps me to think of these interactions as a marketplace:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Query** (`q`): The \"Consumer Need\". What is this token looking for? (e.g., \"I am an adjective looking for a noun\").\n",
    "- The **Key** (`k`): The \"Advertisement\". What info does this token claim to have to offer other tokens? (e.g., \"I could describe a noun\").\n",
    "- The **Value** (`v`): The \"Product\". If a Query matches this token's Key, this is the information that gets passed along.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a single attention head, the process works roughly like this: Each token's Query vector is compared against the Key vectors of *all* tokens in the sequence (including its own). By comparing a Query to a Key, we determine to what degree there is a match. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know the strength of the match between a token's Query and all Keys, we take a proportionate amount of each token's **Value** vector. If the match is strong, we take a large amount of its Value; if the match is weak, we take very little. We then add all these scaled Value vectors together to form one vector that serves as the recommended update for our original token's embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if Token A is \"fast\" (an adjective) and Token B is \"car\" (a noun), Token B's Query might strongly match Token A's Key. Therefore, Token B takes a large chunk of Token A's Value vector to understand that it is not just a car, it is a fast car.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore this in more detail later. For now, just know that the Q, K, and V vectors let token embeddings \"talk\" to each other and update their representations based on the context of the sequence."

    "\n",
    "We will soon see how we determine to what degree a Query and Key are a match. But before we do, we need to adjust them, because we have not yet considered the **position** of the tokens at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the sentence: \"The light is orange\". Regardless of where it appears in the sentence, the token for \"orange\" will start with the exact same embedding. But, because of the way the attention mechanism works, \"The light is orange\" and \"The orange is light\" would be processed the exact same way, even though they mean very different things. So, how do we fix this? How do we give the model the ability to understand that \"orange\" is a color, not a fruit? \n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to add positional info into our token representations. This way, the model will know that \"The\" came just before \"light\", so orange must be a color describing the light. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To add this positional information, modern LLMs use a technique called **Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of adding position information to the token's main embedding at the very beginning, RoPE waits until the Query and Key vectors have been created inside the attention head. It then applies a mathematical rotation to these Query and Key vectors based on their position in the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "By rotating the vectors, RoPE injects information about their relative distances from each other. The model can then easily tell how far apart two tokens are, allowing it to understand the order of the words. The intricacies of RoPE are beyond the scope of this lesson, but the important takeaway is that our Query and Key vectors are adjusted to include positional context before they interact.\n",

    "## **The Dot Product: Comparing Queries and Keys**\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, we have taken two words, represented them as tokens, represented our tokens as embeddings, normalized those embeddings, and fed them into the 2 heads of our first self-attention layer. Each head used them to create a **Query (Q)**, **Key (K)**, and **Value (V)** vector. We just added positional info by rotating the Q and K vectors using RoPE.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready for the attention mechanism. As previously mentioned, within each head, each token's query is compared to all tokens' keys to determine the degree to which they match. but how is this done? How do we determine the degree to which two vectors match? These comparisons use the **dot product**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What is the Dot Product?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors and returns a single number. This number tells us *how similar* those two vectors are. You can think about this calculation in two entirely different, but mathematically identical, ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) The Intuitive Way**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we treat both of our 4D vectors (the Query and the Key we are comparing) as coordinates for a specific point in 4D space and draw arrows to these two points, the dot product starts by looking at the angle between these two arrows and returning a value between -1 and 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If they point in the exact same direction, it returns 1. \n",
    "- If they are perpendicular (unrelated), it returns 0. \n",
    "- If they point in exact opposite directions, it returns -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then multiplies this \"angle match score\" by the lengths of the two arrows themselves. That final result is our dot product.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) The Computational Way**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the method that the LLM actually uses under the hood. In practice, you don't actually need to calculate any angles to find the dot product value. All you have to do is line up the two vectors, multiply their values together (1st number in Q x 1st number in K, 2nd number in Q x 2nd number in K, etc), and then add all those resulting products together into one sum. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: If this sounds familiar, it's because this is exactly what we did above when we turned our 8D embeddings into the Q, K, and V vectors via the learned weight matrices.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why does the dot product matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it gives us a **single score** quantifying to what degree two tokens are similar. Remember, Q is a representation of what a token would find useful, and K is a representation of what a token has to offer. Comparing these two yields to what degree tokens \"match\".\n",
    "\n",

For example, we want to be able to say: *\"To update Token 2 in Head 1, we should take 80% of Token 1's Value and 20% of Token 2's Value.\"* We need to turn our raw math scores into a clean probability distribution that sums to 100%.\n",

    "To do this, we use a function called **Softmax**. But before we can pass our raw scores through Softmax, we have two critical steps to execute: **Scaling** and **Masking**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Scaling the Scores**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we compute the dot product for larger and larger vectors, the resulting match score can become quite large. The issue is that Softmax relies on an exponential function. If we feed very large numbers into Softmax, the exponential component will make the differences between those numbers massive—pushing the highest score up to roughly 100% and completely crushing all other scores down to 0%. The attention mechanism loses its ability to blend subtle context and becomes extremely rigid.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, we implement **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**. Statistically, the variance of a dot product of two independent vectors grows with their dimension. By dividing our raw match scores by the square root of our head dimension (which is $\\sqrt{4} = 2$), we scale down this variance. This simple division pushes the values closer together, ensuring they stay in a stable mathematical range so the exponential component of Softmax behaves properly. \n",

We take any match score that represents a token looking \"into the future\" and replace it with negative infinity ($-\\infty$). Later, when we apply Softmax, any negative infinity value will be mathematically reduced to exactly 0%, guaranteeing that future tokens have absolutely no influence on past tokens.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **What is Softmax?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax takes a list of numbers and converts them into a probability distribution. It ensures that all resulting values are between 0 and 1 (acting as percentages), and that all the values sum up to exactly 1 (100%). \n",

This guarantees that future tokens get a **0%** weight, completely evaporating their influence during the current token's update!\n",

    "## **The Feed-Forward Network**\n",
    "\n",
    "While self-attention routes information *between* tokens to create more contextualized embeddings, the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) is where the model applies the vast knowledge it memorized during training to *each individual token embedding*. It uses the added context from self-attention to determine what information needs to be added to each token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarifying what happens in each step of the FFN while being completely accurate would make this lesson much longer and less accessible. Therefore, I have leaned into the **monosemantic neuron hypothesis**. This view is the easiest to understand, but it is not entirely accurate. What actually goes on in LLMs is still a highly debated area of research, but treating each dimension as a single feature is almost certainly untrue. But it does make the process easier to understand and is a good starting point to build upon. It's also more likely to be true in tiny models like ours. So, it's technically not inaccurate in this context. Just keep in mind that my explanation is a simplification of what is actually going on in large models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FFN consists of three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Up-Projection:** Converts our embedding into a higher dimension by determining to what degree our embedding matches a set of features. In our case a learned weight matrix of 8x24 determines the degree to which our 8D embedding matches 24 different features, and represents this information in a 24D vector.\n",
    "2. **Activation Function:** Applies a mathematical filter to keep useful features and discard useless ones.\n",
    "3. **Down-Projection:** Takes the information that made it past the filter and uses it to decide what information needs to be added to this particular token and maps this back down to the original embedding dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: The Up-Projection**\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we take our normalized 8D embeddings and multiply them by a learned weight matrix. This is called the **Up-Projection**. We will project our 8D embeddings into **24 dimensions** (a 3x expansion). Therefore our Up-Projection weight matrix will be 8 rows x 24 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how we used the dot product to determine to what degree queries matched keys? This works similarly. Each column in the up-projection matrix represents a particular feature. We compare each 8D embedding to all 24 columns (each also 8D) to determine the degree to which our embedding matches the 24 features the model learned to look for during training. The result of this comparison is a 24D vector for each token embedding that serves as a \"profile\" of sorts for the network to work with. The model basically uses this matrix to study each token embedding and extract information from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "By blowing up our embedding from 8 dimensions to 24 dimensions, we are effectively giving the model 24 different \"slots\" or \"scratchpads\" to evaluate our token against. It \"disentangles\" the dense 8D vector, separating it out to ask 24 very specific questions like: *\"To what degree does this token relate to animals?\"*, *\"Is it a plural noun?\"*, *\"Does it usually precede a verb?\"* \n",
    "\n",
    "The up-projection provides the necessary \"width\" for the model to consider many features simultaneously. In most LLMs, the up-projection gives the model 1000s of dimensions to work with rather than our tiny 24.\n",

    "\n",
    "An activation function is a mathematical filter. It looks at the numbers in our newly expanded 24D vector and decides which \"signals\" to let through and which to block. \n",

However, they both serve the exact same mathematical purpose: introducing non-linearity to filter through our features and only pass forward the most active, relevant signals.)*\n",

    "\n",

    "- If the number is **negative**, it changes it to **0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is just: `f(x) = max(0, x)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why is this important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If each of our 24 dimensions is a separate \"feature\" or \"concept\" our model is considering, then: \n",
    "- A positive number means: *\"Yes, I found this feature!\"*\n",
    "- A negative number means: *\"No, I did not find this feature.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "By crushing all negative numbers to 0, ReLU effectively \"turns off\" the features that aren't relevant to this specific token. This creates a **sparse representation**, where only the active, relevant features are passed forward to the next step. It's a way for the model to make a definitive decision: a feature is either present (positive number) or it is completely ignored (zero)."

It is now a highly complex, context-aware mathematical representation that has been continuously molded by its interactions with all preceding tokens and by the vast knowledge the model applied in its Feed-Forward Networks.\n",

    "So how do we convert this 8D embedding to a next token prediction? We run this final embedding through one last learned weight matrix. This matrix will map our embedding to a vector that has the exact same dimension as the size of our vocabulary (which is 20 in our model). Each number in this new 20-dimensional vector corresponds directly to one specific token in our vocabulary. This matrix effectively calculates a \"score\" for every single word in the vocabulary, quantifying how good of a fit each word is to be the next token in the sequence.\n",
